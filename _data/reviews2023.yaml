  review: "Good early new writing of play for 3 actors. How the death of someone close\
    \ hits other relationships. A little too much cliche and too little character\
    \ heart compared to what one would see in more capable or experienced writings.\
    \ Acting reasonable, but again not at the top of the fringe. That said, I\u2019\
    d would still choose to see it."

  review: "This is not for everyone, but I liked it. An original physical theatre\
    \ really enhance by the live folk-opera singer and two cellos backing, and engaging\
    \ in, the whole performance. The music meant there was no clapping between moves\
    \ which led to a fairly seamless performance. The overall theme and \u201Cstory\u201D\
    \ would be utter nonsense even if I had understood it. Something about the relationship\
    \ between people and the wild. I have no clue. But it was a show! Beware though.\
    \ If in the first row, you may be subject to rough physical contact, \u201Cinteraction\u201D\
    \ and some mild health and safely concerns which can either add to the tension\
    \ or ruin the show. There were somewhat violent themes. The originality and singing\
    \ did it for me, and the way the music added to the tension and otherworldy eeriness."

  review: Better than your average big-name comedy. The fact that he can do a comedy
    show about the death of his brother is itself impressive. But it made it more
    than a pass-by-night bunch of laughs. The funniest funeral you have ever been
    to.

  review: 'The best show I have seen by a long way. Incredible. Set in a dementia
    care home, with the audience as visitors and residents, this explores both what
    care means, and what dementia means. The interactions, relationships etc were
    deeply done. The play is written by a care home nurse, and is based on his experiences.
    Very raw. Up there amongst the greats of the last 20 years. '

    system. I thought this was really pretty good for a non-professional show trumped
    up in a short time. I went for the subject matter and wasn't expecting much. Honestly,
    I think this show is going to stick in my memory for a long time, which is what
    I want out of a show.

  review: Okay - I say this in 2021 actually, but it is on again and it was so good
    I have decided to post this review here. A piper from Fife, devoid of all tartan-tat
    stereotype, reflects on his own piping education and career, while also reflecting
    on the life of Gordon Duncan. An amazing mix of storytelling, teaching, personal
    reflection and music. This play will come with me for the rest of my life.
