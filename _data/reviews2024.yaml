  review: Excellent play / two person storytelling and new writing. The interaction
    s of a older femal professor and a new rebel student quite unlike the others in
    class. The overall theme plays with the mix of the intellectual, spiritual, personal
    and physical, entwining and unpicking one with each other over the course of the
    show. Excellent tension held through the show. The is a Literature/writing theme
    that also contrasts the differences in attitude that age brings. I was gripped
    throughout.

  review: Okay. Others wont feel the same. But for me it had the feel of a music performance
    for visitors to the House of Bruar. Or what you'd expect on a cruise ship maybe.
    I think this one is for the tourists. Just not for me.

    liked it - it was very clever wit. It got completely ridiculous at the end, buy

    can come of it. And it didn't. But people will come flocking back just to be abused.

    ghost play, Woman in Black, that meant it didn't quite make the mark.

  review: Talked through the formation of a Chopin Nocturne, building analogies to
    what the piece was saying while trying to be and occasionally being funny. Interesting
    idea. Execution a little hit and miss. Basically Aidan is not an ace comedian
    and not great concert pianist. But he targets a show at the intersection and partially
    succeeds.
