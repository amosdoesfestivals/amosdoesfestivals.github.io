  review: Not up to par on previous ones. Bit samish, fireworks were naff, very much
    scotland the kitsch and backstory involved rewriting history. But large pipe bands
    are always impressive.

  location: The Stand
  review: Slightly haphazard, but funny as Kitson always is. I like my comedy with
    a bit more bite than a typical situation comic provides, so this was always going
    to fail to scratch the itch. This was very much a mess-around and marketed as
    such.

  producer: AR Hawkins
  location: Gilded Balloon Appleton Tower
  review: 'Wow! Perhaps not for everyone: raw and close to the bone. Two stories involving
    living with loss (apparently it will change through the fringe to be different
    two parts chosen from three so I can''t guarantee what you will see will be the
    same) - one the loss of a new born, the other of the loss of partner to AIDS.
    Poignant storytelling, and edge of seat stuff, especially for me in the first
    part performed by Hannah Marina.'

  producer: Andy Linden
  location: Snug at Gilded Balloon Patter House
  review: Moderately interesting storytelling. Story about a tipster and the ups and
    downs. Too linear to be brilliant and lacking layers but acted fairly well.

  rating: Okay
  producer: ACC, ACCF, Haddangse
  location: Assembly George Square
  review: Didn't quite work. They tried to do something a bit more interesting with
    paper props but the lack of dialogue and pastiche nature meant it didn't hold
    together in the first part, which made the punchlines less powerful. Memorable
    for what they tried to do, but a little disengaging.

    \ However I fear this monologue of a diary doesn\u2019t convert so well to the\

  review: 'Dance in 3 or 4 Parts. Well done and pretty original. The fast lighting
    part especially - brought to mind Tron: Legacy, but was an excellent play with
    the dance of light and the dance of dancers. I thought the last solo dance didn''t
    have the edge of the other ones, but altogether I liked it.'

  review: Good performance. However an act rather than a show. Seems a feature of
    some Cirque du Soleil performers that come to the fringe. They don't convert well
    to a whole fringe show.

  review: Two older Irish guys in a pub. Pub conversation. A mix of the inane and
    the personal. I really liked it - for me it dealt with the unmentioned tensions
    in male conversation really well. Funny. Rather Father Ted like. The guys in front
    of me in the toilet queue thought it was inane drivel though. So not for everyone.

  review: A one hour long tiktok video (the old dance kind, not the modern maniac
    stunt version). Like the reserve backing dances for a concert without the actual
    concert. Energetic, and continuous movement, but somewhat lacking virtuosity.
    With random music choices.

  review: A look at Dementia from within an entwinement of King Lear. Interesting,
    diverse layers and media. Intriguingly done. Reflections from Lear into Life,
    with dementia the ripples that muddle it all up. The most multi-faceted play I
    have seen so far this year.

  review: "Billed as an alternative take on the Merchant of Venice, but I felt it\

    \ one of Shakespeare\u2019s better plays, that I had seen in the past."
