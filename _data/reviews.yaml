  review: 'A journalist sits in a chair while her story in narrated. The story is
    her story, and the story of interviews for an article being written by her about
    contended sexual and physical abuse. The play explores the borderlines of sexual
    abuse and sexual experience, its effects near and far, the excuses or even lies
    of the perpetrators, but as much the rationalising of those who suffer. The play
    is very singular in its direction, both showing the nuances involved, the experiences
    and emotions, but also drawing clear lines. As a play, it is perhaps one track,
    focusing on the sex and abuse in an isolated way. It stoops to telling rather
    than showing on occasions, but it is a remarkably tight work. '

  review: A kitchen sink comic melodrama (if that is not an oxymoron), which sticks

    while packing into the play the topics of eating disorders, alcoholism, vegetarianism,
    animal rights, hoarding, phobias, and conflict avoidance and whatever else you
    can think of. The play is all about what is passed down the generations. Plenty
    of funny; the audience is giggling throughout. Incredible set - real food is cooked,
    and you can smell the boiled potatoes from the audience. The whole play is very
    well done, and as with much at the Traverse, it is great to see a show with a
    full cast rather than a solo show. Too over the top to be profound (though it
    gives a good try!), the ending somewhat ridiculous and predictable as one might
    expect from the genre, but definitely a good see.

  review: A gentle monologue to a small audience over an on-set active portrait painting

    exploration of the Bloomsbury Group, from the perspective of Vanessa Bell. Interesting
    reflections on their life, sexuality, and intellectual optimism, illustrating
    the invigoration coming from the discussions of ideas. The play focuses on the
    personal more than the intellectual, perhaps hinting of the feelings that members
    had at the time. It is well done, and evocative, slowly drawing you in. If you
    know nothing of the work of the Bloomsbury members, then it might not be for you.
    But it was a lovely play, and I appreciated it. The painting was a nice touch,
    and again made it something different and very fringe-worthy.

    The story line was a familiar one of family tensions, but by focusing fairly exclusively
    on racial identity, it missed the broader elements of real relationships. However,
    for an exploration of identity, it did a good job, was relatable, and will gel
    with those that share similar experiences.

    of the audience here shows only those from that era care. Matt Forde does his
    bit, but this time round it lacks the edge. Part of the show is focusing on his
    cancer experience. No doubt this has significantly impacted his life, and he wishes
    to share and warn, but it was off-brand and really not that funny. Politically,
    being a card-carrying Labour supporter made him unable to provide any real critique
    of the current incumbents other than that they were bad at marketing. His Trump
    is still better than any, and there were some good laughs along the way, but without
    the real satirical streak that would make the show excellent.

    comes from such a scenario, the way this performance plays it out feels unpredictable.
    Although time jumps are not an unheard of sci fi concept, I have not seen this
    precise premise before. The story is told entirely in rhyme; it grated on me at
    first, but by the end I was in with the flow, and it made for something a little
    different. As storytelling, it handled the fraught relationships in difficult
    situations. Leaving, I was surprised to find myself impressed. I had been attentive

    excellent acrobatics, originality, diversity of acts, excellent showmanship, clever
    theming and background ambience; the show had the audience on their toes. The
    movement was fluid and there was often an element of not knowing where to look
    given all that was happening. It moved from synchronicity to diversity regularly.
    Most circus shows I see are on trend. You see the same elements that everyone
    is copying from everyone. Here you are repeatedly caught by surprise, by both
    big and little elements of the work. The choreography was brilliant too, smooth,
    exciting and dynamic. I've seen Circa since they first arrived at the fringe.
    Their first show was excellent. Circa 2.0 was good but quite similar. However
    here, they have made a step change. This really upped the ante in my book. I was
    very impressed and is amongst the best circus I have ever seen at the fringe over
