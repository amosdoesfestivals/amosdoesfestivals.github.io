  review: Not up to par on previous ones. Bit samish, fireworks were naff, very much
    scotland the kitsch and backstory involved rewriting history. But large pipe bands
    are always impressive.

  review: Slightly haphazard, but funny as Kitson always is. I like my comedy with
    a bit more bite than a typical situation comic provides, so this was always going
    to fail to scratch the itch. This was very much a mess-around and marketed as
    such.

  review: 'Wow! Perhaps not for everyone: raw and close to the bone. Two stories involving
    living with loss (apparently it will change through the fringe to be different
    two parts chosen from three so I can''t guarantee what you will see will be the
    same) - one the loss of a new born, the other of the loss of partner to AIDS.
    Poignant storytelling, and edge of seat stuff, especially for me in the first
    part performed by Hannah Marina.'

  review: Moderately interesting storytelling. Story about a tipster and the ups and
    downs. Too linear to be brilliant and lacking layers but acted fairly well.

  location: Assembly George Square
  review: Didn't quite work. They tried to do something a bit more interesting with
    paper props but the lack of dialogue and pastiche nature meant it didn't hold
    together in the first part, which made the punchlines less powerful. Memorable
    for what they tried to do, but a little disengaging.

  review: 'Dance in 3 or 4 Parts. Well done and pretty original. The fast lighting
    part especially - brought to mind Tron: Legacy, but was an excellent play with
    the dance of light and the dance of dancers. I thought the last solo dance didn''t
    have the edge of the other ones, but altogether I liked it.'

  review: Two older Irish guys in a pub. Pub conversation. A mix of the inane and
    the personal. I really liked it - for me it dealt with the unmentioned tensions
    in male conversation really well. Funny. Rather Father Ted like. The guys in front
    of me in the toilet queue thought it was inane drivel though. So not for everyone.

  review: A one hour long tiktok video (the old dance kind, not the modern maniac
    stunt version). Like the reserve backing dances for a concert without the actual
    concert. Energetic, and continuous movement, but somewhat lacking virtuosity.
    With random music choices.

  review: A look at Dementia from within an entwinement of King Lear. Interesting,
    diverse layers and media. Intriguingly done. Reflections from Lear into Life,
    with dementia the ripples that muddle it all up. The most multi-faceted play I
    have seen so far this year.

  producer: 2b theatre company
  location: Traverse
  review: 'A journalist sits in a chair while her story in narrated. The story is
    her story, and the story of interviews for an article being written by her about
    contended sexual and physical abuse. The play explores the borderlines of sexual
    abuse and sexual experience, its effects near and far, the excuses or even lies
    of the perpetrators, but as much the rationalising of those who suffer. The play
    is very singular in its direction, both showing the nuances involved, the experiences
    and emotions, but also drawing clear lines. As a play, it perhaps one track, focusing
    on the sex and abuse in an isolated way. It stoops to telling rather than showing
    on occasions, but it is a remarkably tight work. '

  review: 'Excellent rope-based circus, with enough variety while maintaining identity.
    Good performance, and pacy. Comic bits, mix with more serious themes. I have perhaps
    seen more flowing and seamless circus acts, but you''d have to be hunting for
    fault for that to matter. The interaction between all the acrobats is fun and
    helps make the show. '
