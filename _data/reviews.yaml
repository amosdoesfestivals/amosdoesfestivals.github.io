    a bit more bite than a typical situation comic provides, so this was always going
    to fail to scratch the itch. This was very much a mess-around and marketed as

  review: 'Wow! Perhaps not for everyone: raw and close to the bone. Two stories involving
    living with loss (apparently it will change through the fringe to be different
    two parts chosen from three so I can''t guarantee what you will see will be the
    same) - one the loss of a new born, the other of the loss of partner to AIDS.
    Poignant storytelling, and edge of seat stuff, especially for me in the first
    part performed by Hannah Marina.'

    together in the first part, which made the punchlines less powerful. Memorable

  review: 'A journalist sits in a chair while her story in narrated. The story is
    her story, and the story of interviews for an article being written by her about
    contended sexual and physical abuse. The play explores the borderlines of sexual
    abuse and sexual experience, its effects near and far, the excuses or even lies
    of the perpetrators, but as much the rationalising of those who suffer. The play
    is very singular in its direction, both showing the nuances involved, the experiences
    and emotions, but also drawing clear lines. As a play, it is perhaps one track,
    focusing on the sex and abuse in an isolated way. It stoops to telling rather
    than showing on occasions, but it is a remarkably tight work. '

  review: A klitchen sink comic melodrama, if that is not an oxymoron, which sticks
    to the plan. Four generations of Northern Irish women argue over a birthday meal,
    while packing in eating disorders, alcoholism, vegitarianism, animal rights, hoarding,
    phobias, and conflict avoidance and whatever else you can think of. The play is
    all about what is passed down the generations. Plenty of funny; the audience is
    giggling throughout. Incredible set - real food is coooked, and you can smell
    the boiled potatoes from the audience. The whole play is very well done, and as
    with much at the Traverse, it is great to see a show with a full cast rather than
    a solo show. Too over the top to be profound (though it gives a good try!), the
    ending somewhat ridiculous and predictable as one might expect from the genre,
    but definitely a good see.

  review: A gentle monologue to a small audience over an on-set portrait painting
    of Virginia Woolf by her sister, that isn't trying to be more than it is. A simple
    exploration of the Bloomsbury life, from the perspective of Vanessa Bell. Interesting
    reflections on their life, sexuality, and intellectual optimism, illustrating
    the invigoration coming from the discussions of ideas. The play focuses on the
    personal more than the intellectual, perhaps hinting of the feelings that members
    had at the time. It is well done, and evocative, slowly drawing you in. If you
    know nothing of the work of the Bloomsbury members, then it might not be for you.
    But it was a lovely play, and I very much appreciated it. The painting was a nice
    touch, and again made it something different and very fringe-worthy.

  review: A look at the move from Leciester to London of a mixed-race Carribean-descent
    girl. Being another play on identity, it is in big company with many shows doing
    the rounds. It was in the spirit of the fringe, with plenty of audience participation.
    The story line was a familiar one of family tensions, but by focusing fairly exclusively
    on racial identity, it missed the broader elements of real relationships. However,
    for an exploration of identity, it did a good job, was relatable, and will gel
    with those that share similar experiences.

  review: As someone who grew up with alternative comedy, Spitting Image, Comic Strip,
    Yes Minister, and war of ideas that was Thatcherite Britain, I find the current
    dearth of political comedy and satire at the fringe a little sad, but the age
    of the audience here shows only those from that era care. Matt Forde does his
    bit, but this time round it lacks the edge. Part of the show is focusing on his
    cancer. No doubt this has significantly impacted his life, and he wishes to share
    and warn, but it was off-brand and really not that funny. Politically, being a
    card-carrying Labour supporter made him unable to provide any real critique of
    the current incumbents other than that they were bad at marketing. His Trump is
    still better than any, and there were some good laughs along the way, but without
    the real satirical streak that would make the show excellent.
