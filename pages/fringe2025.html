        <p>My name is Amos Storkey - I am an academic, an Edinburgh resident and love the Festivals. Home is the best place to be in the whole world in August :). 
        </p><p>These brief show reviews (mostly fringe, but sometimes others) are provided as people keep asking for them and seem to find them useful. A great play differs from a bad one, but these reviews are all personal opinion, do not indicate any sort of agreement with any performance, and your mileage may vary. I have been festivalling for over a quarter of a century, so I have become fairly good at picking what is likely to have a chance of being good, but still try to throw in randomness to try to prevent me just reinforcing my biases.
        </p><p>In general, I find good plays and some physical theatre more long-term memorable and reflective than comedy (with some exceptions), though I do enjoy a good comic. 
        </p><p>My star ratings are designed to match the usual expectations for such things, but I also provide a more fine-tuned rating. These are: (1*) awful, (1*) bad, (2*) poor,
        (3*, but wouldn't go again in a Groundhog Day) okay, (3* but might choose to redo) fair, (4*) good, (4*) very good, (5* - only a few a year) excellent, (5* - one a year maybe and will never forget this show) outstanding.

        <p>This will keep extending during the fringe. If you have a show you want to recommend me, please do (as a punter, not a promoter). You will find my email online somewhere.</p>
